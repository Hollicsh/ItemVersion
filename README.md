**ItemVersion adds information to your tooltip about when an item was added to World of Warcraft.**

## Useful for

- Clearing your bags and bank of old stuff
- Identifying crafting reagents and loot from your transmog runs
- Looking back on WoW history

## Features

- A complete database of the version/expansion in which every item was added.
- Where-you-need-it accessibility in the item tooltip.
- Weekly updates with the latest items. A refreshed release will automatically occur (at least)
  every Tuesday at 16:00 UTC, just slightly after reset.
- API exposed for use by other addons.
- Open source visibility.

## Usage

Just install the addon like normal and mouse over any item!

![Demo of tooltip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t-mart/ItemVersion/master/docs/images/demo.png)

## Translators Needed

If you know another language and want to help translate ItemVersion, please
[check this out](https://github.com/t-mart/ItemVersion/tree/master/ItemVersion/Locales).

Translations are living things. If you see an improvement to make, don't hesitate to bring it up.

## Support

- **An item has the wrong version.**

  First, verify it on [wowhead.com](https://www.wowhead.com/).

  Note that, in some cases, items are added towards the end of an expansion that actually used in
  the _next_ expansion, making them appear to have too early of a version. For example,
  [Marrowroot](https://www.wowhead.com/item=168589/marrowroot), a herb used in Shadowlands, was
  actually added to the game during the previous expansion, Battle for Azeroth. And, ItemVersion
  will display Battle for Azeroth because it is canonically correct.

  However, to instead display the expansion that players probably expect in these cases, turn on the
  "Include community updates" option on the options screen. Then, the Marrowroot example would
  display Shadowlands.

  (These community updates are an ongoing effort. If you have discovered an item that feels like its
  in the wrong expansion, please lend a hand and create an [issue on the GitHub project
  page](https://github.com/t-mart/ItemVersion/issues)).

- **Anything else**
